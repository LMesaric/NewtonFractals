# Newton Fractals

Eclipse project for generating PNG images of Newton Fractals using Newton's method for calculating complex roots of 1.

Already rendered images are available in this repository in directories named *WIDTH*x*HEIGHT*. Since they are rather large (up to 300 MP and 70 MB per image), they should be downloaded instead of previewing them in the browser.
